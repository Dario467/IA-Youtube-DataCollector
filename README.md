# IA-Data-Collector
## About The Project
A Streamlit-based tool that automates the process of identifying and analyzing viral YouTube videos.
Based on category filters and specifications, the application utilizes the Gemini API (Google GenAI) to generate a list
of relevant channels. Then, using the YouTube Data API, it retrieves the most popular videos from those 
channels and extracts their key metrics (views, likes, title, creator, date, etc.).

Finally, the results are automatically stored in a Google Sheet, organized into columns with key information such as 
video name, creator, view count, likes, publication date, and more. This workflow streamlines the exploration of YouTube 
trends by combining generative AI, automated analysis, and cloud services.
